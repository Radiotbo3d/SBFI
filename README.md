### What is this?

These are replacement front idlers for Vorons (and Voron-based machines).
This design is available for Voron Trident and Voron 2.4.

### Improvements?

This is a version remixed/based on [BFI](https://github.com/clee/VoronBFI/tree/main)
my version has several improvements or things that I have changed to fit my needs.
#### Changes:
- They are now symetrical
- They now have a magnetic cover so you don't need to see those screws anymore
- They now have curved edges instead of chamfers (very similar to [Ramalama2](https://github.com/Ramalama2/Voron-2-Mods/tree/main/Front_Idlers))

### Some more things you need to know:
All the clips for the z belts on the voron 2.4 are the exact same as the BFI
The internal bearing stack holder is also the exact same as the BFI (so if you had the BFI and you want to change to SBFI you don't need to reprint that part)

## BOM

### SBFI for Trident
(It's the exact same BOM as the BFI but you just need 8 6x3mm magnets (4 per idler)
For Trident, you'll need:
- 4× M5×40 SHCS
- 4× M5 hex nuts
- 2× 5mm-diameter pin, 18mm long

...plus the same shim/bearing stack setup for each idler as the original stock front idlers.

### SBFI for Voron 2.4
(It's the exact same BOM as the BFI but you just need 8 6x3mm magnets (4 per idler)
For V2.4, you'll need:
- 4× M5×30 BHCS 
- 4× M5 hex nuts
- 2× 5mm-diameter pin, 18mm long
- 2× M3 t-nuts
- 2× M3×16 BHCS

...plus the same shim/bearing stack setup for each idler as the original stock front idlers.

# Whose fault is all this anyway?

- @clee, initial prototype
- @bythorsthunder, early feedback and testing
- @KayosMaker, first port to V2.4
- @hartk1213, Micron and Doom 

While not directly built upon it, this design is definitely inspired by @Ramalama2's front idlers.
